**A better version of this guide is available [here](https://github.com/KobeW50/ReVanced-Documentation/blob/main/YT-ReVanced-Guide.md#before-you-begin)**



### **Before You Begin**

- You will need a device running Android 8 or newer

- This guide is for non-root installations




### **1. Getting the APKs**

**1.1)** Download and install [ReVanced Manager](https://revanced.app/download). (If you already have it installed, make sure it is the latest version.)

**1.2)** Download, but do **NOT** install this [YouTube 19.47.53 APK](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/youtube/youtube-19-47-53-release/youtube-19-47-53-android-apk-download/). (This is the currently suggested YouTube APK for patching.)

> For a more robust method of downloading the YouTube APK, see [this comment](TODO).




### **2. Patching**

**2.1)** Open ReVanced Manager. If prompted, grant ReVanced Manager the permission to install unknown apps.

**2.2)** Go to the ReVanced Manager settings and disable `Save patched app`. (This prevents a bug.)

**2.3)** Go to the Patcher tab and press Select an app. Then, press **Storage**, as shown in [this image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KobeW50/ReVanced-Documentation/refs/heads/main/images/yt-revanced-guide/select-from-storage.png).

**2.4)** Select the YouTube APK you just downloaded. (It will likely be in your Downloads folder.)

**2.5)** ReVanced Manager should now show the YouTube app selected, with several dozen selected patches. Press the Patch button to begin patching.

> If you want to customize the patch selection, see [this comment](TODO).

**2.6)** Keep ReVanced Manager open while the app is being patched. Make sure no errors occur. (The patch log should be easily readable.)




### **3. Installing YouTube ReVanced and GmsCore**

**3.1)** When patching completes press Install. 

> You can also export the patched APK file using the button on the bottom left, as shown in [this image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KobeW50/ReVanced-Documentation/refs/heads/main/images/yt-revanced-guide/export-apk.png).

> If there is a popup saying that the installation was blocked because it is an unknown app, press "**More details**" and then "**Install anyway**" as shown [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KobeW50/ReVanced-Documentation/refs/heads/main/images/yt-revanced-guide/install-anyway_old.jpeg).

**3.2)** If ReVanced GmsCore is not installed, you will need to install it in order for YouTube ReVanced to run in a non-root environment. If it's not installed, the [download page](https://github.com/ReVanced/GmsCore/releases/latest) will automatically open when you try opening YouTube ReVanced. If you are using a Hauwei device, be sure to install the special version for your device.

You are now done! Note that there is a section in the YouTube ReVanced settings for configuring the ReVanced features. Also, see [this comment](TODO) for info on making YouTube links open in YouTube ReVanced and setting up the external download feature.



### **How do I update YouTube ReVanced?**

To update, you will need to download the suggested YouTube APK, patch it, and install it. Of course make sure your ReVanced Manager is up-to-date. There is no reason to uninstall your current YouTube ReVanced or ReVanced Manager when updating.
