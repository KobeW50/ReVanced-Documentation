**1. What is the more robust way to download the YouTube APK?**

Instead of relying on this guide (which is manually updated) to get a YouTube APK, it's best to use the YouTube version suggested in ReVanced Manager, as shown in [this image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KobeW50/ReVanced-Documentation/refs/heads/main/images/yt-revanced-guide/suggested-version.png). Tap on the suggested version in ReVanced Manager to open a search for that YouTube APK. Find and open the result from apkmirror.com with the suggested version. You'll need to make sure that you download the `nodpi` variant of the suggested YouTube version rather than the bundle variant, as shown in [this image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KobeW50/ReVanced-Documentation/refs/heads/main/images/yt-revanced-guide/apkmirror-youtube.png).



**2. How do I customize the patch selection?**

To change the patch selection, enable the `Allow changing patch selection` option in the ReVanced Manager settings. Then, after selecting the YouTube APK from storage, press the Selected patches and configure the patches and patch options to your liking. If you don't understand what something does it's best to not tinker with it.



**3. How do I make YouTube links open in YouTube ReVanced?**

> If you are using MIUI, you may need to use [Hidden Settings for MIUI](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ceyhan.sets). After you install it, open it and tap on "Manage applications". Then, continue with the steps below:

3.1) Go to the App info of the **unpatched** YouTube app and tap on "Set as default" / "Open by default" -> Open supported links, **Off**. (Alternatively, uninstall or disable the unpatched YouTube app.)

3.2) Open the App info of YouTube ReVanced and tap on "Set as default" / "Open by default" -> Open supported links, **On**.

3.3) Return to the previous page. Tap "Supported web addresses", and turn them all **On**.



**4. How do I set up the external download feature?**

Open YouTube ReVanced -> Settings -> ReVanced -> Player -> External downloads, and enable the `Show external download button` and/or the `Override download action button` toggle(s). You will also need to install the downloader. By default, the downloader will be set to [NewPipe](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases/latest). Another popular downloader is [Seal](https://github.com/JunkFood02/Seal/releases/latest), which the package name is `com.junkfood.seal`.
