About Extended
==
`ReVanced Extended` is a sub-project of `ReVanced`.

To make this clear, I created all of my repositories as `fork repositories`.

Like `ReVanced`, all source code for `ReVanced Extended` is open source and meets the GPL v3.0.
## ​
`ReVanced Extended` has all the features I personally wanted to implement in ReVanced

As a result, most of the features that were in `Vanced` / `Vanced Extended` have been incorporated into `ReVanced Extended`.
## ​
`ReVanced Extended` is a project that I lead alone, not as a team.

Therefore, it may be discontinued at any time due to my personal reasons.

By the way, Thank you so much for visiting my tiny Github repository :)
