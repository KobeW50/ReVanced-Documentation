##### **1. What is ReVanced and ReVanced Extended?**
[ReVanced](https://revanced.app/) is a free modular patcher for Android apps such as YouTube. It can be used to create a YouTube application that has extra features and customizability, similar to how a browser extension works, but for an app.

ReVanced Extended is a derivative project of ReVanced of just patches made specifically for YouTube, YouTube Music, Vanced MicroG, and Reddit. ReVanced Extended has some extra features on top of what ReVanced offers and is developed independently by inotia00. ReVanced Extended is not affiliated with ReVanced.



##### **2. Is it safe?**
Yes. MicroG, official patching tools, and the patches are all open-source. You can read the code and verify that it is safe.



##### **3. How do I get ReVanced Extended?**

You can follow the [wiki guides](https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedextended/wiki/guide/) for installation instructions. You can also find other guides in the subreddit.



##### **4. Is revancedextended.com or revanced.io legitimate?**

No. All sites that distribute pre-patched/ready-to-use ReVanced Extended APKs are unofficial and unsafe. If you signed-in to Google using an APK from revancedextended.com, revanced.io, or any similar site, you should change your password and remove any devices that are signed in.



##### **5. Why can't I just download a pre-made APK instead of patching it myself?**

Due to legal reasons, ReVanced Extended cannot be directly distributed. Anyone distributing pre-patched ReVanced or ReVanced Extended APKs is not official and potentially untrustworthy. The only guaranteed safe way to install ReVanced Extended is by patching it yourself with one of the official methods.



##### **6. What features are different between ReVanced Extended and ReVanced?**

ReVanced and ReVanced Extended are constantly updating their features so the answer to this question is always changing. The best way to answer this is by installing ReVanced Extended and comparing it to ReVanced. You can also compare the list of patches between the [ReVanced Extended GitHub](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches/tree/revanced-extended#readme) and the [ReVanced site](https://revanced.app/patches?pkg=com.google.android.youtube), but keep in mind that some patches can contain several features and options within, so just looking at the patches doesn't tell the full story.



##### **7. Can I have YT ReVanced Extended and YT ReVanced installed as separate apps?**

If you patch with the non-root method, YT ReVanced Extended and YTM Extended will have a unique package name and will not conflict with any apps.



##### **8. How do I update ReVanced Extended?**

Refer to the "Updating ReVanced Extended" section in the [YT ReVanced Extended installation guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedextended/wiki/yt-guide/#wiki_updating_revanced_extended) or in the [YTM Extended installation guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedextended/wiki/ytm-guide/#wiki_updating_revanced_extended) for info on updating your ReVanced Extended app.



##### **9. I found a bug or have a feature request. Where can I submit it?**
